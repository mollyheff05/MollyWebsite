            <div class="disney"><img src="IMG_3844.jpg" alt="disney castle">
                <h4>Disney castle</h4>
                <p> This was a photo I took in February at Disney World. I was there on a school trip because I was in the Colorguard of the Marching Band and we got to perform our on parade here! It was one of the best experiences I have had.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="waterfall"><img src="IMG_6296.jpg" alt="waterfall">
                <h4>Waterfall</h4>
                <p> I took this photo last month at a beautiful park. It has a nice sceneic trail that takes you to this waterfall. We went at the perfect time because the trees were turning for Fall, this made it 10x more beautiful.</p>

            <div class="pressure"><img src="IMG_4272.jpg" alt="Pressure Ceramic Project">
                <h4>Pressure</h4>
                <p>This ceramic piece was my big project for my senior year. It took me about 3-4 months to make it. The name of the art was "Pressure" and it was in got into a local Art Gallery for a few weeks. </p>

            <div class="bowl"><img src="IMG_4369.jpg" alt="Glazing Bowl">
                <h4>Glazing Bowl</h4>
                <p>This was another piece of artwork I made in my ceramics class, my senior year. It was more just to try out a fun glazing style I had not done before.</p>
