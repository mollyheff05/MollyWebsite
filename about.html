            <div class="concert_text"><p>I love going to concerts with friends. I am almost always listening to music, it just helps me function. This concert was from the beginning of October. It was a Daniel Caesar concert at Madison Square Garden and it was one of the best nights. I love his music so much and whenever you see music live, it just makes it 10 times better so I enjoyed it so much. His music is more R&B which is my current favorite music genre. </p>
